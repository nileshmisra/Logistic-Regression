# Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression
Starting with the preprocessing using numpy and pandas library the code deal with NAN values and other columns which needed to be drop as per requirements. Data visualization is done using Matplotlib and Seaborn library through which some useful insights have been shown from the dataset.
Finally Logistic Regression algorithm is implemented using Scikit-Learn library and accordingly confusion matrix and accuracy score is displayed at last.
